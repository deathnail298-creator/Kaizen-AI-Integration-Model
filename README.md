Kaizen AI Integration Model

A Cross-Domain Workflow Methodology for Reliable AI-Assisted Work Using LLMs
Version 1.0.0

Overview

The Kaizen AI Integration Model is a structured, reliability-focused workflow designed to stabilize, verify, and scale human–AI collaboration across any domain. Unlike prompt-based shortcuts, Kaizen emphasizes process engineering, comprehension enforcement, cross-model verification, and repeatability — making it suitable for enterprise, education, research, and technical operations.

Why Kaizen Exists

Modern LLMs are powerful but unpredictable. Output drift, hallucinations, and inconsistency prevent organizations from adopting AI at scale. Kaizen provides:

A systematized “Holy Tenet” comprehension protocol

Multi-model disagreement resolution

Error-reduction loops

Instructor → Student training pathways

Step-locked workflow stages that eliminate drift

Kaizen is model-agnostic and has been tested across ChatGPT, Gemini, Qwen, and Grok.
