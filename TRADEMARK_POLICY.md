Kaizen AI Integration Model™ — Trademark & Brand Usage Policy

Copyright © 2025 Nathan Rudloff. All rights reserved.
“Kaizen AI Integration Model™,” “KZN Model™,” and associated terminology are protected trademarks.

This document outlines the allowed and prohibited uses of the Kaizen branding.

1. What Is Protected?

The following are trademarked brand elements:

Kaizen AI Integration Model™

KZN Model™

Kaizen Workflow Architecture™

Kaizen Triad™ (Human Intent → AI Output → Human Validation Loop)

Any official Kaizen certification titles

Official Kaizen logos (if added later)

2. Non-Commercial Usage (Allowed Without Permission)

The trademark may be referenced informationally without approval:

Academic papers

Research citations

Open-source discussion

Review, critique, commentary

“Based on the Kaizen AI Integration Model™” in non-monetized contexts

This falls under nominative fair use.

3. Commercial Usage (Requires Permission)

Businesses must obtain written permission to use Kaizen trademarks when:

Selling training, classes, or courses about Kaizen

Offering consulting services based on Kaizen

Advertising themselves as “Kaizen-certified”

Selling derivative frameworks, workbooks, software, or tools

Using Kaizen titles or brand language in marketing

Using Kaizen terminology inside a paid software product

If money is involved, trademark permission is required.

4. Forbidden Uses (Not Allowed Under Any Circumstance)

Misrepresenting affiliation (“official Kaizen partner” without approval)

Claiming ownership over Kaizen, Kaizen derivatives, or naming variations

Using Kaizen branding to imply OpenAI endorsement

Using Kaizen branding in harmful, fraudulent, or misleading ways

If unsure, contact us for clarification.

5. Certification Labels

The following require explicit authorization:

“Kaizen Certified Instructor™”

“Kaizen Certified Consultant™”

“Kaizen Certified Organization™”

Any badge, certificate, or label asserting Kaizen mastery

Organizations may create their own internal certificates, but may not use the Kaizen trademark unless licensed.

6. How to Request Trademark Use

Contact the owner:

📧 nathan.rudloff.business@gmail.com

(or whichever email you want to substitute)

Include:

Organization name

Proposed usage

Business model (if relevant)

Branding examples (if applicable)

Most requests are accepted as long as they are ethical and non-misleading.

7. Enforcement

Unauthorized commercial use of trademarked elements may result in:

Takedown notices

Revocation of commercial license

Legal enforcement if necessary

Kaizen is designed to proliferate — enforcement only applies to misuse.

8. Summary

The name is protected.

Non-commercial use = fine.

Commercial use = permission needed.

Certifications require approval.

Misuse will be corrected.

Kaizen is open and collaborative — but the branding remains controlled to maintain consistency, quality, and global trust.
