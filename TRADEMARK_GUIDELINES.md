Version 1.0 — 2025

Trademark Owner: Nathan Rudloff
Protected Marks:

Kaizen AI Integration Model™

Kaizen Integration Model™

K.A.I.M.™

Any confusingly similar variations

These guidelines describe how individuals, companies, educators, and organizations may reference, teach, and build upon the Kaizen AI Integration Model while respecting trademark law.

1. What You May Do Without Asking Permission

You may freely:

1.1. Refer to the name in descriptive ways

Examples:

“This workshop teaches skills inspired by the Kaizen AI Integration Model™.”

“Our approach includes concepts from the Kaizen model.”

“We follow the Kaizen AI Integration Model™ workflow.”

1.2. Teach the methodology (non-commercially)

Schools, nonprofits, and individuals may use the name for non-revenue-generating education.

1.3. Write articles, blogs, papers, or research

Citing the name for commentary, critique, or explanation is allowed.

1.4. Build derivative methods

You can build your own version, so long as you do not market it as Kaizen™.

2. What You May Not Do Without Permission
2.1. Use the exact name commercially

No paid classes, consulting, workshops, certifications, or software may use:

Kaizen AI Integration Model™

Kaizen Integration Model™

K.A.I.M.™

without written permission.

2.2. Imply endorsement

You may not claim:

Affiliation

Partnership

Certification

Approval

from Nathan Rudloff unless explicitly granted.

2.3. Market derivative work as "Kaizen"

Example violations:

“Kaizen Pro Edition”

“Kaizen 2.0 Workflow”

“Kaizen for Healthcare™”

“Certified Kaizen Practitioner” (not allowed without permission)

2.4. Use confusingly similar names

Avoid names like:

“Kaizen AI Framework”

“Kaizen Model Prime”

“KaiZen”

“KaiznAI”

If consumers could mistake your product for an official one, it’s not allowed.

3. What You Can Do With Permission

Permission grants you the right to:

Sell “Certified Kaizen Practitioner” courses

Offer “Kaizen Integration Consulting”

Brand workshops with the Kaizen trademark

Use Kaizen branding in internal corporate training

Bundle the Kaizen name in software products

Create official derivative frameworks under Kaizen branding

Permission is granted on a case-by-case basis and almost always approved
as long as the 3% royalty license is active and in good standing.

4. How to Request Trademark Use Permission

Email:

📧 nathan.rudloff.business@gmail.com

Include:

Your name / company

Description of how you want to use the trademark

Whether revenue is involved

Expected scale and timeline

Trademark permission is free, provided your commercial activity follows the 3% royalty model.

5. Enforcement Policy (Light but Necessary)

The goal is proliferation, not gatekeeping.

Trademark enforcement exists only to:

Prevent consumer confusion

Prevent fraud

Maintain clarity about what is official

Protect the long-term reputation and integrity of the model

Most honest actors will never encounter any enforcement issues.

6. Summary (Plain English)

Use the name freely when discussing, citing, or teaching non-commercially.

If you're making money using the name, you need permission.

You cannot brand anything as “Kaizen” or “Certified Kaizen” without approval.

Permission is easy and almost always granted if you’re operating in good faith and paying the 3% commercial royalty.

This protects the brand while maximizing global adoption.
