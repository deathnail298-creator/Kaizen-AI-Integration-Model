Copyright © 2025 Nathan Rudloff. All rights reserved.
The Kaizen AI Integration Model™ (“KZN Model”) is released publicly under CC BY-NC 4.0 for non-commercial use.
Any commercial use requires a separate license and written approval from the creator.
1. Allowed Non-Commercial Use (Already Permitted)

Under CC BY-NC 4.0, the following uses require no commercial license:

Academic study, research, or coursework

Personal or organizational experimentation

Internal, non-revenue training

Open-source modification or adaptation

Non-monetized content, teaching, or workshops

For these uses, only attribution is required.

2. Definition of Commercial Use

The KZN Model is considered commercially used when:

It appears in a product, service, class, certification, consulting program, or software that generates revenue.

A company or individual charges money for training, consulting, workshops, or integration services involving Kaizen.

A for-profit entity uses Kaizen to create material offered to clients or customers.

A modified or extended version is sold, sublicensed, bundled, or monetized.

If money changes hands, Kaizen is considered commercially used.

3. Required Royalty for Commercial Use

All commercial users agree to:

A universal 3% royalty on all gross revenue derived from Kaizen-based products, training, consulting, services, certifications, or derivative frameworks.

There are no upfront costs.
Royalties are reported quarterly unless negotiated otherwise.

4. Derivative Works

Commercial derivatives remain covered by this license unless:

The derivative removes all Kaizen architecture,

AND removes every Kaizen rule sequence,

AND removes all terminology from the Kaizen framework,

AND replaces the iterative human-AI workflow with an entirely unrelated mechanism.

If a framework uses Kaizen’s structure, rules, methodology, or sequencing, it is considered a derivative and requires a license.
