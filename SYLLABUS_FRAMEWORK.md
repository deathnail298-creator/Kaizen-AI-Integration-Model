📘 COURSE TITLE

Kaizen AI Integration Model™: Practical Human-AI Workflows

📅 COURSE LENGTH

Choose one:

4-Week Intensive (corporate bootcamps)

8-Week Standard (general education)

12-Week Deep Dive (universities, certifications)

🎯 COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course teaches students how to apply the Kaizen AI Integration Model™, a structured human-AI collaboration workflow designed for reliability, safety, and rapid iteration. Students will learn prompting, verification, adversarial testing, multi-model cross-checking, iterative refinement, and the “Holy Tenet”: questioning everything.

Graduates will be able to integrate AI into real workflows with high confidence and low failure rates.

🎓 LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

Use the Kaizen workflow to solve real problems with AI models.

Apply chunking, locking, comprehension enforcement, and adversarial testing.

Perform cross-model verification (using ChatGPT, Gemini, Qwen, Claude, etc.).

Detect hallucination patterns and model drift.

Interpret, debug, and reconstruct AI outputs reliably.

Build repeatable, scalable AI workflows for business or personal use.

Document AI-assisted work in a transparent, auditable manner.

🧩 COURSE MODULES

Each module corresponds to one week (or one session in a bootcamp).

Module 1 — Introduction to the Kaizen Model

What the model is and why it exists

Human-in-the-loop safety

The “Holy Tenet” explained

Overview of the Four Pillars

Module 2 — Chunking & Instruction Locking

Chunk theory

Breaking complex tasks into micro-units

Locking instructions to prevent drift

Hands-on lab: Students chunk and lock a multi-step assignment

Module 3 — Comprehension Enforcement

Forcing the model to “prove” understanding

Synthetic comprehension testing

Summaries, rewrites, cross-reflection

Hands-on lab: Students run comprehension tests until stable

Module 4 — Multi-Model Adversarial Testing

Using a second model as a “hostile reviewer”

Gemini, Grok, Claude, Qwen as adversaries

What disagreement means

Hands-on lab: Students break each other's outputs

Module 5 — Reconstruction & Verification

Reverse prompting

Detecting hallucinations

Reconstruction drills

Hands-on lab: Rebuild a corrupted output into a correct one

Module 6 — Applied Problem Solving

Pick an application track:

Writing

Policy

Coding

Documentation

Creative work

Legal/Compliance

Education

Medical (non-diagnostic)

Students complete a real-world case using the Kaizen model.

Module 7 — Capstone Development

Students design their own Kaizen workflow for a real use-case

Instructors provide iterative review

Peer adversarial testing included

Module 8 — Capstone Presentation

Students present their final Kaizen workflow

Peer critique

Instructor scoring using provided rubric

Certification decision (if applicable)

📝 GRADING BREAKDOWN (Editable)

Participation: 15%

Weekly Labs: 25%

Midterm Adversarial Review: 20%

Capstone Project: 40%

📑 MATERIALS REQUIRED

Access to at least two AI models (ChatGPT + Gemini/Qwen/etc.)

Computer with internet access

Course workbook (included)

Instructor slides (provided separately)

📜 INSTRUCTOR NOTES

Always enforce the Holy Tenet.

Encourage students to challenge the AI and each other.

Use failure as a teaching tool — the model improves through iteration.

Remind students: this is not a magic trick; it's a process discipline.
